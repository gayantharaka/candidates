# candidates
Candidates is an Android app that shows details of candidates that were retrieved from randomuser API. I decided to use MVP(Model View Presenter) as a design pattern for this app implementation due to several reason
Clear separation of responsibilities between components,Modularity,Easier testing etc. UI implementation,Code structuring must be improved in order to release this app as a product.
To me the impressive part of this app is the data rertrieval from server via RxJava. 
Note to reviewer: Kindly not that select feature and showing the selected candidate details in Selected Tab feature is still not developed.
