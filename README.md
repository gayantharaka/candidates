# candidates
Candidates is an Android app that shows details of candidates that were retrieved from randomuser API. I decided to use MVP(Model View Presenter) as a design pattern for this app implementation due to several reasons.
Clear separation of responsibilities between components,Modularity,Easier testing etc. UI enhancements must be done if playstore upload or production release is needed.
To me the impressive part of this app is the data rertrieval from server via RxJava. 
Note to reviewer:Added all features that were required.
